        What is it?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Many people living with a mental illness report that negative stereotypes, and the resulting potential for discrimination,
        causes them more suffering than the illness itself. As a result, two thirds of those suffering from mental illness
        are too afraid to seek the help that they need.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mental illness affects people of all ages and from all walks of life. It can take many forms, including depression, anxiety
        and schizophrenia. Most individuals find ways to live with their illnesses but how they are treated by others often
        proves to be more of a challenge than the illness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        That’s why it’s important to start a conversation around mental health during the MoodCheck challenge and learn to become
        more mindful about how the things you do every day affect the way you feel.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How does it work?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The goal is to motivate us all to be mindful about how the things we do affect the way we feel. This increased awareness
        is known to be a strong predictor of improved mental health and well-being.
